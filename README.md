# SixNonBlondes ❌👱‍♀️

Hello! We are six non-blond people in a very blond city (hi Malmö 👋), attending the every-[non]hair-type-welcome [**AI & Games Summer School**](https://school.gameaibook.org/).

We come from Italy, Spain, Peru, and Scotland, and we’ve built this small (but fierce 💥) project in just a day and a half during the Game Jam. The times we didn’t sleep? Honestly, mostly because we were out drinking **blonde** beers 🍺 — for research purposes, obviously.

## 🕹️ Project:
Think _Subway Surfers_ but:
- You **don't collect coins**.
- You **don't press buttons**.
- And you're occasionally **held hostage by memes**.

Yes, really.

You **dodge obstacles using your eyes**, thanks to an eye-tracking system built into Unity. But we made it even dumber smarter: sometimes a meme will pop up on the screen, and the only way to make it disappear is by **looking directly at it**.
That’s right: you must acknowledge the meme to proceed. You can’t escape it. This is your life now.

### But what about the AI?
Well… we were planning to build a Python-based ML eye tracker from scratch.
Then we found out **Unity already had a plugin** for that.

So the two ML experts on the team did what any responsible machine learning engineers would do:  
**Pivoted to full-time meme collection**.  
And **meme deployment**.  
And now, **meme README writing**.

### How it works
- The player moves left and right based on your gaze (using Unity's eye-tracking integration).
- Obstacles come flying at you like your to-do list.
- Memes pop up randomly. You have to look at them to make them disappear.
- Hit an obstacle and it’s game over. Or laugh too hard at the meme and forget to dodge — also game over.

## Tech Stack 🧠💻
- Unity (C#) for the game logic.
- Unity Eye Tracking Plugin (because reinventing the wheel is for people with more time).
- A curated set of premium-quality memes 😎.
- A whole lot of not doing ML

## Installation 🚀

> [!NOTE]
> **1.** It works on our machines™️  
> **2.** Works best with functioning eyes and questionable humor tolerance.

- Clone this repo.
- Open the Unity project.
- Run the scene.
- Stare into the void. The void stares back.
- Look around. Obey the memes. Dodge the chaos.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Eye-tracking requires a webcam and decent lighting. Try not to game in a cave.

## Known Issues 🐛
Sometimes the meme just wants to be looked at forever.

If your eyes are too small, the tracker might get shy.

Game does not detect side-eye (yet).

No blondes were involved in the making of this game.
The only blondes involved were the beers. And they were deeply appreciated. 🍻
