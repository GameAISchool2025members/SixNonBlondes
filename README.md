# SixNonBlondes 👱‍♀️🤖

Hello! We are six non-blond people in a very blond country (hi Malmö 👋), attending the every-[non]hair-type-welcome [**AI & Games Summer School**](https://school.gameaibook.org/).

We come from Italy, Spain, Peru, and Scotland, and we’ve built this small (but fierce 💥) project in just a day and a half during the Game Jam. The times we didn’t sleep? Honestly, mostly because we were out drinking **blonde** beers 🍺 — for research purposes, obviously.

## 🕹️ Project: Don't Blink!
Think Subway Surfers, but you don't collect coins, and you don't press buttons.
Instead, you dodge obstacles using only your eyes — literally.

Thanks to some eye-tracking magic (aka computer vision and messy calibration attempts), you control the player’s position just by looking around. Blink and you crash. Or don’t blink and still crash. Depends on how well you calibrated. We make no promises.

How it works
Obstacles come at you like your deadlines.

You move the player by moving your eyes, using an AI-powered eye-tracking system.

If you hit something... well, you had one job.

## Tech Stack 🧠💻
Unity (C#) for game development

Eye-tracking AI (running in a separate Python module with OpenCV)

WebCam input for real-time tracking

Some calibration. Some chaos. A bit of beer. A lot of improvisation.

## Installation 🚀
Disclaimer: It works on our machines™️

Clone this repo.

Open the Unity project.

Run the scene.

Stare into the void. The void stares back.

Note: Eye-tracking requires a webcam and decent lighting. Try not to game in a cave.

## Known Issues 🐛
Calibration sometimes thinks your lamp is an eyeball.

Eye tracking might glitch if you're too expressive. Stop being so passionate.

Works best when sitting still like a gamer goblin.
